EDB Failover Slots (pg_failover_slots) is an extension that makes logical replication slots practically usable across a physical failover.

This extension does the following:

- Copies any missing slots from the primary to the standby
- Removes any slots from the standby that are not found on the primary
- Periodically synchronizes position of slots on the standby based on the primary
- Ensures that selected standbys receive data before any of the logical slot walsenders can send data to consumers
