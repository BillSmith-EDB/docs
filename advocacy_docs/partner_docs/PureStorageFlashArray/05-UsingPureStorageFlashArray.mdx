This section features some use cases that show how Pure Storage Flash Array can integrate with your EDB Postgres Advanced server or PostgreSQL instance.

## Use Pure Storage FlashArray with EDB Postgres Advanced server and/or PostgreSQL 

Pure Storageâ€™s FlashArray provides enterprise grade availability with all-flash technology.  This can be used with your EDB Postgres Advanced server for uses such as: 
- Volume Snapshots
- Continuous Storage Replication 
- Synchronous Replication, which can provide workload mobility and High Availability

What these all provide for your EDB Postgres Advanced server or PostgreSQL instance are:
- Database cloning for copies or replication topologies.
- Snapshots for data protection (B&R) with asynchronous replication.
- Continuous Replication for near-0 RTO disaster recovery.
- High availability or storage mobility (moving from one array to another non-disruptively) with ActiveCluster.

Pure Storage FlashArray can help your EDB Postgres Advanced server databases maintain a High-Availability state with its Synchronous Replication using its ActiveCluster replication solution.  ActiveCluster replication is part of the Purity Solution, which is the software heart of FlashArray.  Purity ActiveCluster protects your EDB Postgres Advanced server or PostgreSQL databases using an active-active implementation, meaning that it will distribute the workload across several nodes in a cluster to keep your data safe and available in case of a failure.
