ArcGIS is a geographic information system (GIS) technology that provides tools to capture, view, edit, manage, analyze, and share location data. Esri ArcGIS Pro is the single desktop GIS application that users can connect their EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL databases to. Esri ArcGIS Pro allows users to explore, visualize and analyze data; create 2D maps and 3D scenes; and share their work to an ArcGIS Enterprise Portal. Esri ArcGIS Enterprise is the foundational software system for GIS.  It is the backbone for running the Esri suite of applications and custom applications. Esri ArcGIS Enterprise and Esri ArcGIS Pro are integrated for creating maps and data.

The Esri ArcGIS solutions provide customers with industry-specific configurations for ArcGIS that have been designed to meet key business requirements and will support common workflows in an organization. Esri clients interact with geodatabases that include a collection of tables, views, and functions. The geodatabase schema can be stored in flat files or database systems. Esri ArcGIS Pro is a professional desktop GIS application that you can explore, visualize, and analyze GIS data. 

Esri ArcGIS can connect with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL databases in different modes to create an enterprise geodatabase.  The enterprise geodatabase consists of a multi-tier architecture that implements advanced logic and behavior in the application tier, for example the Esri ArcGIS software on top of a data storage tier (RDBMS software), or in our case EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL.  The geographic data is then managed between both the ArcGIS software and the RDBMS.  The pieces of an enterprise geodatabase define how data is stored, accessed and managed by ArcGIS.
