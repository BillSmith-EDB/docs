You can use the `dnf` or `yum` package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. `dnf` or `yum` will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install an individual package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

You can list the dependencies of a package by running the following command:

-   On Fedora | RHEL | CentOS | Rocky Linux AlmaLinux: `repoquery --requires --resolve <package_name>`
-   On Debian | Ubuntu: `apt-cache depends <package_name>`

Where, `package_name` is the name of the package that you want to install.

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password; use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as13`.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the `log` subdirectory of the `data` directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file. For more information about `Modifying the postgresql.conf File`, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/latest/)


## Installation Pre-requisites

Before using an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a Linux host, you must:

**Install Linux-specific Software**

You must install `xterm, konsole`, or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by EDB installers.

**Install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus Installation Prerequisites (Optional)**

Before using an RPM to install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java version 1.8 or later. On a Linux system, you can use the `dnf` or `yum` package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    # yum -y install java
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install java
    ```

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

**Request Credentials to the EDB Repository**

Before installing the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit the EDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

-   Create the repository configuration file.
-   Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
-   Install the repository keys and additional prerequisite software.
-   Install Advanced Server and supporting components.

## Installing on CentOS 7 or Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a CentOS 7 or Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8 host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform specific commands:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    # yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

    # yum makecache
    ```

    On Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install epel-release

    # dnf makecache
    ```

-   For Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8, enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

    On Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8, disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

You must download and install the repository key. Provide the registered `username` and `password` with the `curl` command to download the repository key using the following command:

```text
curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Use the following command to install the key:

```text
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Then, you can use `yum install` or `dnf install` command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

-   On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as13-server
    ```

-   On Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as13-server
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).

!!! Note
    During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing on RHEL x86_64

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a RHEL host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform specific commands:

    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text

    # yum makecache
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

    # dnf makecache
    ```

-   Enable the repository:

    On RHEL 7, enable the `optional`, `extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

    On RHEL 8, enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-*-rpms` repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )

    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

    On RHEL 8, disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

You must download and install the repository key. Provide the registered `username` and `password` with the `curl` command to download the repository key using the following command:

```text
curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

    ```

`yum` or `dnf` will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use `yum` or `dnf` to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb*
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb*
    ```

!!! Note
    The `yum upgrade` or `dnf upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter `yum --help` on your command line.
