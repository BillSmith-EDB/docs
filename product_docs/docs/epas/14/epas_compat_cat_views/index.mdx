The System Catalog Views provide information about database objects. There are two catagories of catalog views:

- The System Catalog Views derived from PostgreSQL which may or maynot have extra information when accessed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

- The Oracle Catalog Views that provide information about database objects in a manner compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views.

For detailed information about EDB Postgres Advanced Server's compatibility features and extended functionality, see the complete library of EDB Postgres Advanced Server documentation at [EDB docs website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/).
