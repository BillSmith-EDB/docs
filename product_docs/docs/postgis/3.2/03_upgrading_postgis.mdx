For information on upgrading to PostGIS 3.1, see the version 3.1 [Upgrading](/postgis/3.1/03_upgrading_postgis) topic.

## Upgrading from PostGIS 3.1 to 3.2

To avoid accidental upgrades, PostGIS version 3.1 and 3.2 use different package names. So, upgrading to version 3.2 requires that you first uninstall version 3.1. Once you install version 3.2, you can upgrade the PostGIS extensions. 

1. Create the PostGIS extensions in PostGIS version 3.1, if you haven't already. For instructions, see [Creating extensions](/postgis/latest/02_creating_extensions/).

1. Uninstall PostGIS version 3.1. 
   
   For EPAS version 14:

   ```shell
   yum -y erase edb-as14-postgis31
   ```

   For older versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

   ```shell
   yum erase edb-as<xx>-postgis-31
   ```
   
   Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

   For more information, see [Uninstalling PostGIS](/postgis/latest/05_uninstalling_postgis/).

1. Install PostGIS version 3.2. For instructions, see [Installing PostGIS on RHEL 7/OL 7 x86](/postgis/latest/01a_installing_postgis/installing_on_linux/x86_amd64/postgis_rhel7_x86/).

1. Upgrade the PostGIS extensions using the following command: 

   !!! Note
   If you first upgraded from a PostGIS version earlier than 2.5 to PostGIS version 3.1, then you must `DROP` the `postgis_raster extension` before executing the command. 
   !!!

   ```sql
   SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();
   __OUTPUT__
