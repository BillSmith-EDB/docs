Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
#  Set up the EDB repository:
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

#  Replace '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' below with
#  your username and password for the EDB repository:
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo

#  Install the EPEL repository:
dnf -y install epel-release

#  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools

#  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
dnf -qy module disable postgresql
```

## Install the package

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install epel-release
    ```

4.  The following  steps are applicable only for Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8 platform:

    a. Enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

    b. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

5.  Invoke the platform-specific command to install `PostGIS`:

    On CentOS 7, to install the latest version of PostGIS version for EDB Advanced Server version 14.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as14-postgis32
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8, to install the latest version of PostGIS version for EDB Advanced Server version 14.0:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as14-postgis32
    ```

    On CentOS 7, to install the latest version of PostGIS for EDB Advanced Server versions older than 14.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis
    ```

    where &lt;xx> denotes the Advanced Server version older than 14.0.

    On CentOS 7, to install PostGIS older versions (for example PostGIS 3.0.2) for EDB Advanced Server version 14.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as14-postgis3-3.0.2
    ```

    On CentOS 7, to install older PostGIS versions for EDB Advanced Server versions older than 14.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis-<y.y.y>
    ```

    where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version older than 14.0 and &lt;y.y.y> is the older PostGIS version.
    
    For example, to install PostGIS 2.5.4 on Advanced Server 12:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as12-postgis-2.5.4
    ```

    When you install an RPM package signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y` and press `Return` to continue.

    !!! Note
        After installing PostGIS with a package manager, you must manually create a template database and the required PostGIS extension.

Where `14` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `14` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using.
