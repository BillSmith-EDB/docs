Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
#  Set up the repository by replacing 'USERNAME:PASSWORD' below
#  with your username and password for the EDB repositories:

echo "deb https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list

#  Add support for secure APT repositories:
apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

#  Add the EDB signing key. Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials
#  for the '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' placeholders.
wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -

#  Update the repository metadata:
apt-get update
```

## Install the package

```shell
apt-get -y install edb-as14-postgis3
```

Where `14` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `14` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using.
