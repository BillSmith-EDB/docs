| Type         | Description |
| ------------ |------------ |
| Bug fix      | Fixed the issue where the history cleanup job is not automatically configured for non-MDN databases in a MMR triggered based cluster. |
| Bug fix      | Fixed a data consistency issue that occurs in an `UPDATE-UPDATE` conflict use case where some of the column changes from the target node are not reverted if the source node changes are accepted and the target node changes are discarded. [Support ticket #83594] |
| Bug fix      | Fixed a corner case issue where the newly added rows in a non-MDN database might result in redundant `INSERT-INSERT` conflicts. [Support ticket #81651] |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue where synchronize replication fails when EDB Postgres Advanced Server is the publication database configured to use WAL based change data capture (CDC) and an Oracle database is set up as the first subscription database and EDB Postgres Advanced Server as the second subscription database. |
