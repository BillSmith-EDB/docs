title: Installing the RHEL 8 xDB RPM Package on IBM Power (ppc64le)
---
There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the Repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

1. Set up the EDB repository:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

   This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

1. Add your EDB credentials to the edb.repo file:  

   ```shell
   sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
   ```

   Where `USERNAME:PASSWORD` is the username and password available from your
   [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

1. Install the EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
   dnf makecache
   ```

1. Enable the codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-\*-rpms repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it:

   ```shell
   ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
   subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
   ```

1. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
   ```shell
   dnf -qy module disable postgresql
   ```

## Installing the Package

```shell
dnf -y install edb-xdb
```

!!! Note
    When Replication Server is installed on a machine where Java is not present, the JDK is installed as part of the installation process. Since in this case the JDK was installed via Replication Server as its dependency, if you subsequently remove the JDK, Replication Server is also removed.

    If Java 1.8 or greater exists before installing Replication Server, the installed Replication Server is not removed on removal of the JDK.

## Initial configuration

Before using Replication Server, you must download and install JDBC drivers. See [Installing a JDBC driver](installing_jdbc_driver) for details.
