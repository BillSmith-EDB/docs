## Choosing and installing a JDBC driver

Which JDBC driver you use depends on what database you're using. If you're using:

- **EDB Postgres Advanced Server**, use the EDB JDBC driver. To download the latest driver, see [EDB Connectors](https://enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#edb-connectors) on the EDB Downloads page. For installation instructions, see [Installing and configuring EDB JDBC Connector](/jdbc_connector/latest/04_installing_and_configuring_the_jdbc_connector/).

- **PostgreSQL**, use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. To download the latest supported driver (Java 8), see the [JDBC drivers section](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/) on the PostgreSQL Downloads page. 

- **Oracle**, use the freely available [Oracle JDBC](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html) driver.

- **Microsoft SQL Server**, use the freely available jTDS driver.

## Configuring the driver

After downloading the driver, create a symlink in the `XDB-install-folder/lib/jdbc` directory that points to the location where you installed the driver. 

For Linux, create a symlink for the driver using these naming conventions:

   |        Driver        |  symlink name  |
   | -------------------- | -------------- |
   | EDB                  | edb-jdbc18.jar |
   | PostgreSQL           | postgresql.jar |
   | Oracle               | ojdbc.jar      |
   | jTDS                 | jtds.jar       |


 For interactive installers, the drivers need to be copied to the `XDB-install-folder/lib/jdbc` directory and renamed using the same naming conventions.

## Retaining the driver in an upgrade 

When upgrading from a previous version of Replication Server, the already shipped or placed drivers in `XDB-install-folder/lib/jdbc` are retained. Check that the retained drivers are supported below:

   |    Driver   |  Minimum supported version  |
   | ----------- | --------------------------- |
   | EDB         | edb-jdbc17.jar              |
   | PostgreSQL  | postgresql-42.2.12.jre7.jar |
   | Oracle      | ojdbc7.jar                  | 
   | jTDS        | jtds-1.3.1.jar              |

If your drivers are no longer supported, then you must replace them with the latest available version and follow the instructions in [Configuring the driver](#configuring-the-driver).
