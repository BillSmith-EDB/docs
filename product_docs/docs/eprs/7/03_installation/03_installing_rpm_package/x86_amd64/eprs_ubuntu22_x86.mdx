Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
#  Set up the EDB repository
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list

#  Replace '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' below with
#  your username and password for the EDB repositories:
echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <USERNAME> password <PASSWORD>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf

#  Add support for secure APT repositories:
apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

#  Add the EDB signing key. Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials
#  for the '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' placeholders.
wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -

#  Update the repository metadata:
apt-get update
```

## Install the package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
apt-get install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
apt-get install <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | Replication console and the Replication Server command line interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                    |
