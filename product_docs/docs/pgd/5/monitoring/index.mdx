Monitoring replication setups is important to ensure that your system performs optimally
and doesn't run out of disk space or encounter other faults that might halt operations.

It's important to have automated monitoring in place to ensure that, for example, if
replication slots start falling badly behind, the administrator is alerted and can
take proactive action.

EDB provides Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM), which supports PGD from version 8.1. See [Monitoring EDB Postgres Distributed](/pem/latest/monitoring_BDR_nodes/) for more information.

Alternatively, tools or users can make their own calls into information views
and functions provided by the BDR extension. See [Monitoring through SQL](sql) for
a detailed description.

EDB Postgres Distributed also integrates with OpenTelemetry, allowing you to
use existing reporting setup to follow the state of the EDB Postgres Distributed
cluster. See [OpenTelemetry integration](otel) for details.
