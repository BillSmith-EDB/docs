title: "Limitations"
---


This is a (non-comprehensive) list of limitations that are
expected and are by design. They are not expected to be resolved in the
future.

-   Replacing a node with its physical standby doesn't work for nodes that
    use CAMO/Eager/Group Commit. Combining physical standbys and BDR in
    general isn't recommended, even if otherwise possible.

-   A `galloc` sequence might skip some chunks if the
    sequence is created in a rolled back transaction and then created
    again with the same name. This can also occur if it is created and dropped when DDL
    replication isn't active and then it is created again when DDL
    replication is active.
    The impact of the problem is mild, because the sequence
    guarantees aren't violated. The sequence skips only some
    initial chunks. Also, as a workaround you can specify the
    starting value for the sequence as an argument to the
    `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function.

-   Legacy BDR synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction
    confirmation different from the one used by CAMO, Eager, and Group Commit.
    The two are not compatible and must not be used together. Using synchronous
    replication to other non-BDR nodes, including both logical and physical
    standby is possible.
