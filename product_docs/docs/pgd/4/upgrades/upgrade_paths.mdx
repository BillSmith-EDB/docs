## Upgrading from 3.6

Currently there are no direct upgrade paths from 3.6 to 4.  You must first upgrade your cluster to 3.7 before upgrading to 4.  See [Upgrading from 3.6](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-from-version-36) in the 3.7 documentation for more information.

## Upgrading from 4

Beginning with version 4, EDB Postgres Distributed has adopted semantic versioning. All changes within the same major will be backward compatible lowering the risk when upgrading and allowing you to choose any later minor or patch release as the upgrade target.
