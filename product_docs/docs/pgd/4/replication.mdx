Provides the essential multi-master capabilities for PostgreSQL clusters:

- Enables application and database upgrades without requiring downtime
- Provides clusters row level eventual consistency by default
- Concurrent streaming of large transactions smooths replication and reduces lag
- Tools to monitor operation and verify data consistency

Includes advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and up to 5X throughput:

- Guards applications from committing transactions more than once
- Conflict-free synchronous replication with two phase commit
- Concurrent updates using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Configurable column level conflict resolution along with customizable conflict handling and transformation

New in EDB Postgres Distributed 4.1:

- Faster, fully online major version upgrades
- Replication lag control with asynchronous replication
- More flexibility for durable replication with Group Commit
- Greater control with command line interface
- Simplified synchronous replication configuration with SQL level interface
- Automatic management of distributed sequences

Additional features:

- Automatic DDL and DML replication in an active-active mesh network
- Failover and switchover infrastructure to re-route traffic in case of failures or during maintenance operation
- Advanced conflict detection and conflict management
- Differentiated replication sets to control which data gets replicated and to which downstream databases
- Cluster expansion/consolidation 
- Rolling schema change/migration using cross-schema replication
- Recovery from user error through solid integration with backup and recovery tools
- Improved security model with Geo-fencing, allowing selectively replicate data for security compliance and jurisdiction control
