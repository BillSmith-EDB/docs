-   Replication
    -   Physical Replication Enhancements
________

-   Physical Replication
    -   Introduce the `synchronous_replication_availability` parameter.
        A value of async for this parameter enables asynchronous
        processing during the period of insufficient number of standby
        servers being available (when compared with the values as per
        synchronous_standby_names). The behavior automatically reverts back
        to synchronous replication when the required number of synchronous
        standby servers reappear.
