## Avoid flooding transaction logs

EDB Postgres Extended Server provides WAL pacing delays to avoid flooding transaction logs. The WAL pacing configuration parameters are:

    - `wal_insert_delay_enabled`
    - `wal_insert_delay`
    - `wal_insert_delay_size` 
    
When `wal_insert_delay_enabled` is enabled, a session sleeps based on the value of `wal_insert_delay` after WAL data of at least the value of `wal_insert_delay_size` has been generated. The default is off.

## Additional tracing and diagnostics options

EDB Postgres Extended Server allows you to enable timeouts based on logging of trace messages in specific code
paths. Use the `tracelog_timeout` configuration parameter to allow logging of trace messages after a timeout of
the specified time occurs.

## Selective physical base backup and subsequent selective recovery/restore

Backups are always, by default, taken of the entire database cluster. It is also
possible to back up individual databases or database objects by specifying
the "-L" option multiple times for multiple databases to the `pg_basebackup` utility.
Template databases are backed up by default. Note that WAL data for excluded
databases is still part of the WAL archives.

The backup activity stores the list of database objects specified via this option
in the backup label file. The presence of these objects in the backup label file
automatically causes selective recovery of these databases. Recovery of template
databases and of global metadata related to users, languages etc. is also carried
out as usual. WAL data belonging to excluded databases is ignored during the
recovery process. Attempts to connect to excluded databases will error out once regular
operations start post the recovery.
