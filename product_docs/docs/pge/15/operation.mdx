-   COPY FREEZE

    If we are inserting frozen tuples, then check if the given page
    has all frozen tuples and mark the page as all-visible and frozen.
    Since the relation is not visible to any other transactions when running
    in this COPY FREEZE mode, we usually expect the pages to contain only
    tuples with frozen-xmin and invalid-xmax. This improves performance by
    avoiding expensive rewrites later by operations like VACUUM.

-   Reduce locking of ALTER TABLE ... REPLICA IDENTITY

-   WAL pacing delays to avoid flooding transaction log

    Introduce the `wal_insert_delay_enabled`, `wal_insert_delay`
    and `wal_insert_delay_size` configuration parameters. When the
    `wal_insert_delay_enabled` setting is turned on, a session sleeps
    a time of `wal_insert_delay` after WAL data of size at least
    `wal_insert_delay_size` has been generated. The default is off.

-   Additional tracing and diagnostics options

    Enable timeout based logging of trace messages in specific code
    paths. Allows logging of trace messages after a timeout of
    `tracelog_timeout` (configuration parameter) occurs.

-   Selective physical basebackup and subsequent selective recovery/restore

    Backups are always, by default, taken of the entire database cluster; it is also
    possible to back up individual databases or database objects by specifying
    "-L" option multiple times for multiple databases to the `pg_basebackup` utility.
    Template databases are backed up by default. Note that WAL data for excluded
    databases is still part of the WAL archives.

    The backup activity stores the list of database objects specified via this option
    in the backup label file. The presence of these objects in the backup label file
    automatically causes selective recovery of these databases. Recovery of template
    databases and of global metadata related to users, languages etc. is also carried
    out as usual. WAL data belonging to excluded databases is ignored during the
    recovery process. Attempts to connect to excluded databases will error out once regular
    operations start post the recovery.
