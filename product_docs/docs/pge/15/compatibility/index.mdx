## Rollback options

In PostgreSQL, any ERROR within a transaction will rollback all actions
by that transaction. This behavior is different to other DBMS, such
as Oracle and SQL Server, where an ERROR causes rollback of only the last
statement. This difference in transaction handling semantics doesn't
cause a problem in all cases, but it does make code migration more
difficult in some cases.

One workaround is to manually introduce a SAVEPOINT, internally known as
subtransactions into the application code. This is time-consuming and
difficult to test. SAVEPOINTs are additional statements and so increase
transaction latency. Given the overhead of additional development work
and slower performance this approach is not viable in most cases.

EDB Postgres Extended Server allows you to rollback just the current statement.
The purpose of the Statement Level Rollback feature is to provide an
optional mode to choose whether to allow rollback of the whole transaction
or just the current statement. No manual recoding is required, though
there is some additional overhead, just lower than SAVEPOINTs.

For more information, see [`transaction_rollback_scope` parameter](txnrollback) for information on setting the transaction rollback scope inside the database and [JDBC properties for rollback scope](jdbctxnrollback) for setting the scope in a JDBC connection.



## Cursors with prepared statements

EDB Postgres Extended Server allows declaring a cursor over a previously created prepared statement.

For example,

 ```
 PREPARE foo AS ...; DECLARE c1 CURSOR FOR foo;
 ```

## Calling functions 

For compatibility with Oracle, and general simplicity, EDB Postgres Extended Server allows calling functions using plpqsl without the PERFORM keyword.  
   
For example, 

```
BEGIN somefunc(); END
```

where `somefunc`is not a keyword.
