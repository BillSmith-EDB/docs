## Other compatibility features

-   Cursors with Prepared Statements

    Allows declaring a cursor over a previously created prepared
    statement, for example: `PREPARE foo AS ...; DECLARE c1 CURSOR FOR foo;`

-   plpgsql: Allow calling functions without PERFORM keyword

    For compatibility with Oracle, and general simplicity, allow calling
    functions without the PERFORM keyword.  This works as long as `somefunc`
    used below in the example is not a keyword.
    Example: `BEGIN somefunc(); END`
