title: "Activating regions"

---

When you activate a region, BigAnimal prepares the infrastructure required to deploy clusters. Activating a region can increase your cloud costs. 

The following table lists the different states of a region.

| States | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Activating       | Cloud infrastructure is being set up by BigAnimal.                                                                         | 
| Active       | Cloud infrastructure setup is completed and the region is ready for creating clusters.                                                                    |
| Suspended    | BigAnimal clusters and infrastructure in the region are deleted, except for backups and logs. Backups and logs continue to be maintained based on the retention period set when the cluster was last active.  |
| Deleted      | BigAnimal clusters and infrastructure in the region are deleted. Backups and logs are not maintained.                                               |
| Error        | An error occurred while transitioning to another state. Contact EDB support to troubleshoot the error.  | 


## Activate a new region

You can activate a region ahead of time or at cluster creation.

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. This step is dependent on whether you already have active regions or not:
   - If this is your first time activating regions, you can directly move to the next step.
   - If you already have regions activated, a list of previously activated regions appears. Select **Activate New Region**.
     
1. Select the cloud service provider (CSP) of the regions you want to activate. A list of regions associated with the CSP appears.

1. Select the region you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

1. Select **Activate Region(s)**.

## Suspend, reactivate, or delete a region

Before you suspend or delete a region you must delete all clusters in that region.

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. A list of previously activated regions appears. 
     
1. Select the icons next to a region to: 
   - suspend or delete an active region.
