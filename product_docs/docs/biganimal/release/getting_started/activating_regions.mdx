title: "Activating regions"

When you activate a region, BigAnimal prepares the infrastructure required to deploy clusters. Activating a region can increase your cloud costs. The following changes occur in your cloud infrastructure when you change the state of a region.

## Activate a new region

You can activate a region ahead of time or at cluster creation.

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. This step is dependent on whether you already have active regions or not:
   - If this is your first time activating regions, you can directly move to the next step.
   - If you already have regions activated, a list of previously activated regions appears. Select **Activate New Region**.
     
1. Select the cloud service provider (CSP) of the regions you want to activate. A list of regions associated with the CSP appears.

1. Select the region you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

1. Select **Activate Region(s)**.

## Suspend or delete a region

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. A list of previously activated regions appears. 
     
1. Select the icons next to a region to: 
   - suspend or delete an active region. 
   - reactivate a suspended region.
