title: "Activating regions"

---

When you activate a region, BigAnimal prepares the compute and networking resources required to deploy clusters. Note that these added resources can increase your cloud costs. 

You can activate a region a head of time or when you create or restore a cluster. 

Each region you activate displays a status. The status is available on the Create cluster and Restore cluster pages and the Regions page. For more information on the different region statuses, see [Region status reference](#region-status-reference).



## Activate a new region

You can activate a region ahead of time using the **Admin > Regions** page or at cluster creation or restore.

1. If setting up a region prior to creating or restoring a cluster, go to **Admin > Regions** page. If you are creating or restoring a cluster for a region that is not yet active, you are brought to the Regions page.

1. This step is dependent on whether you already have active regions or not:
   - If this is your first time activating regions, you can directly move to the next step.
   - If you already have regions activated, a list of previously activated regions appears. Select **Activate New Region**.
     
1. Select the cloud service provider (CSP) of the regions you want to activate. A list of regions associated with the CSP appears.

1. Select the region you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

1. Select **Activate Region(s)**.

## Suspend, reactivate, or delete a region

Before you suspend or delete a region you must delete all clusters in that region.

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. A list of previously activated regions appears. 
     
1. Select the icons next to a region to: 
   - suspend or delete an active region. 
   - reactivate a suspended region.

| Activating       | You have activated the region and BigAnimal is setting up the compute and networking resources to support the cluster you requested. Backups and logs aren't available yet.                                                                         | 
| Active       | BigAnimal has completed setting up the compute and networking resources. The region has at least one cluster and you can create more. The region has backups and logs.                                                                  |
| Suspended    | You have deleted any active clusters. BigAnimal has removed the compute and networking resources. The backups and logs are still available. BigAnimal continues to maintain backups and logs based on the retention period set when the cluster was last active.  |
| Deleted      | You have deleted the clusters. BigAnimal has removed the compute and networking resources. The backups and logs are no longer available. Only Account Owners can delete a region.                                            |
| Error        | An error occurred while trying to activate or suspend the region. Contact [EDB support](/biganimal/release/overview/support) to troubleshoot the error.  |
