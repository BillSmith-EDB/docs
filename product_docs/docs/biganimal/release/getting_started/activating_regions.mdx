title: "Activating regions"

When you activate a region, BigAnimal prepares the infrastructure required to deploy clusters. Note that activating a region can increase your cloud costs.

| Region Status | Description                                                                                                                                            |

| Not enabled  |  .                                                                                                             |
| Active       | Cloud infrastructure setup is completed and ready for cluster creation.                                                                                |
| Suspended    | Backups and logs for clusters are maintained per each cluster's retention period when it was last active. All other cloud infrastructure is suspended. |
| Deleted      | Active clusters (if any) are suspended, and all cloud infrastructure is deleted.                                                                       |
| Error        | An error occurred while transitioning to another state. Contact support for help.                                                                      |


## Activate a new region

You can activate a region ahead of time or at cluster creation.

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. This step is dependent on whether you already have active regions or not:
   - If this is your first time activating regions, you can directly move to the next step.
   - If you already have regions activated, a list of previously activated regions appears. Select **Activate New Region**.
     
1. Select the cloud service provider (CSP) of the regions you want to activate. A list of regions associated with the CSP appears.

1. Select the region you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

1. Select **Activate Region(s)**.

## Suspend or reactivate a region

<!-- Do clusters have to be suspended or deleted for suspending a region -->
<!-- Is cloud infrastructre in a suspended region suspended or deleted? -->

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. A list of previously activated regions appears. 
     
1. Select ![Pause](../images/Pause.png) or the ![Reactivate](../images/Reactivate.png) next to the region you want to suspend or reactivate.
