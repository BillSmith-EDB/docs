title: BigAnimal Terraform provider
---

With BigAnimal’s [Terraform provider](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal), you can more efficiently incorporate BigAnimal into your existing cloud infrastructure workflows. You provision cloud resources from the Terraform CLI, instead of through a provider’s portal. 

The current version of the provider provides modules for creating, reading, updating, and deleting clusters and regions.


!!!note
   We provide support offered for the BigAnimal Terraform provider itself and not for the underlying environment. 

## Prerequisites
To use Terraform with BigAnimal, you need: 

- A BigAnimal account with an organization set up. If you don't already have a BigAnimal account, see [Getting started with the BigAnimal free trial](/biganimal/latest/)

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) downloaded and installed
- an API key for use within the Terraform application. See [Getting an API Token](getting-an-api-token)


*I'm thinking we don't need to mention Go here because it seems like it is only necessary if you are compiling the provider from the sources and if someone wants to do that the instructions and requirements are in the readme. I don't think that is necessary once the provider is registered.*

## Configure the provider

*How do you do this? and would the correct heading be Configure the provider or Authenticate the provider?*

```
terraform {
  provider "biganimal" {
    public_key=
    private_key=
    }
  }
}
```

See [Provider Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration).


## Getting an API Token

In order to access the BigAnimal API, fetch an API bearer token and export it into your environment.

This can be done by using the script located [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/api/get-token.sh) as follows

```bash
sh ~/hackery/edb/cloud-utilities/api/get-token.sh
Please login to https://auth.biganimal.com/activate?user_code=JWPL-RCXL with your BigAnimal account
Have you finished the login successfully? (y/N) y
{
  "access_token": "<REDACTED>",
  "refresh_token": "<REDACTED>",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Once the token has been retrieved, set it in your environment as follows

```bash
export BA_BEARER_TOKEN=<REDACTED>
```
