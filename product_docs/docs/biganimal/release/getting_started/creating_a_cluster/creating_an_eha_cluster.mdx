title: Creating an extreme-high-availability cluster
---

When you create an extreme-high-availability cluster, you need to set up the data group. Extreme-high-availability clusters can contain one or two data groups. 

1. In the **Cluster Info** tab, select **Extreme High Availability**. Specify your cluster name and password on the **Cluster Settings** tab.

1. Select **Next: Data Groups**. 

1. Select the **Nodes Settings** tab. In the **Nodes** section, select **Two Data Nodes** or  **Three Data Nodes**. 

    The default for one data group is three data nodes. For more information on node architecture, see [Extreme high availability (Preview)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview).

1. In the **Database Type** section:

   1.  Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -   **Oracle Compatible** is powered by [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/). View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility). EDB Postgres Advanced Server is compatible with all three cluster types.
    
    1.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. See [Database version policy](../../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.

1. Select the settings for your cluster according to [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/). Find the instructions for the **Node Settings** tab in [Cluster Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) and [Additional Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#additional-settings-tab). Find instructions for the **DB Configuration** tab in [DB Configuration tab](../creating_a_cluster/#db-configuration-tab).

1. Select **Create: Data Group**. The data group preview appears. 

1. To finish creating your cluster, select **Create Cluster**. If you want to create a second data group, select **Add a Data Group**.

## Creating a second data group

After creating the first data group, you can create a second data group for your extreme-high-availability cluster by selecting **Add a Data Group** before you create the cluster. 

By default, the settings for your first data group populate the second data group's settings. However, if you want to change certain settings you can. Just know that your changes can change the settings for the entire cluster. That being said, the database type and cloud provider must be consistent across both data groups. The data groups and the witness group must all be in different regions. Otherwise, you can choose the second data group's settings as needed. 

When choosing the number of data nodes for the second data group, see [Extreme high availability (Preview)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview) for information on node architecture.
