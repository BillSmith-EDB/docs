title: Periodic maintenance

EDB performs periodic maintenance to ensure stability and security of your clusters. EDB performs minor version upgrades and patch updates as part of this periodic maintenance. You are notified in the BigAnimal portal prior to maintenance occurring. Details are available on the [BigAnimal status page](https://status.biganimal.com/). You can subscribe to get these updates in a feed by selecting **Subscribe to Updates** on the status page. 

EDB reserves the right to upgrade customers to the latest minor version without prior notice in an extraordinary circumstance. You cannot configure minor versions. 

In some cases these updates may terminate existing network connections to your clusters. If that happens, the outage should be very brief - typically less than 30 seconds. Be sure your applications are configured to automatically reconnect when connections are interrupted. Most modern database libraries do this by default.
