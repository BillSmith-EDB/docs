BigAnimal adheres to the following security standards, certifications, and capabilities: 

## SOC 2 Type I

Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage their customer data. Service providers can securely manage their customer data by protecting the interests of the customer’s organization and the privacy of its clients. SOC 2 defines criteria for managing customer data based on five trust service principles: security, availability, process integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.  

SOC 2 reports are unique to each organization. In line with specific business practices, each designs its own controls to comply with one or more of the trust principles.

Type I classification describes a vendor’s systems and whether their design is suitable to meet relevant trust principles.

SOC 2 Type I compliance for BigAnimal certifies that:

- BigAnimal securely stores the customer data by providing end-to-end encryption. 

- The customer application and data are protected behind the network or application firewall. Also, BigAnimal can successfully handle intrusion detection and any security incidents. 

- BigAnimal supports access control and two-factor authentication for an added level of security and privacy. 

- BigAnimal provides the capabilities for performance and process monitoring, including disaster recovery and quality assurance that ensures high availability.

## SOC 2 Type II

Like SOC 2 Type I, a SOC 2 Type II report is also an internal controls report capturing how a company safeguards customer data and how well those controls are operating. Companies that use cloud service providers use SOC 2 reports to assess and address the risks associated with third party technology services. Independent third party auditors issue these reports that cover the principles of security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy.

SOC 2 Type I is different from Type II because a Type I assesses the design of security processes at a specific point in time. While a Type II report assesses how effective those controls are over time by observing operations for six months.

## GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in European Union (EU) law on data protection and privacy, as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.

GDPR compliance implies both privacy and security mechanisms definition, enforcement, and control, including evidence collection. 
BigAnimal supports GDPR at service level, which means BigAnimal protects the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur in EU member states.

## Single sign-on (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. True SSO allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors. 

BigAnimal supports SSO by enabling users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites with just one set of credentials.

## Role based access control (RBAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

BigAnimal allows RBAC to regulate access based on the roles of individual users in the organization. This allows the administrators to control the capabilities of end-users at both broad and granular levels. BigAnimal enables the administrators to designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user. Administrators can also align roles and access permissions accordingly.
