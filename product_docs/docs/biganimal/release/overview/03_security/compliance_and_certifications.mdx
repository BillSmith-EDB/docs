BigAnimal adheres to the following security standards and certifications: 

## SOC 2 

Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 is an auditing procedure that ensures service providers securely manage their customer data. Service providers can securely manage their customer data by protecting the interests of the customer’s organization and the privacy of its clients. SOC 2 defines criteria for managing customer data based on five trust service principles: security, availability, process integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.  

SOC 2 reports are unique to each organization. In line with specific business practices, each designs its own controls to comply with one or more of the trust principles.

### Type I 

SOC 2 Type I classification describes a vendor’s systems and whether their design is suitable to meet relevant trust principles.

Type I compliance for BigAnimal certifies that:

- BigAnimal securely stores the customer data by providing end-to-end encryption. 

- The customer application and data are protected behind the network or application firewall. Also, BigAnimal can successfully handle intrusion detection and any security incidents. 

- BigAnimal supports access control and two-factor authentication for an added level of security and privacy. 

- BigAnimal provides the capabilities for performance and process monitoring, including disaster recovery and quality assurance that ensures high availability.

### Type II

Like SOC 2 Type I, a SOC 2 Type II report is also an internal controls report capturing how a company safeguards customer data and how well those controls are operating. Companies that use cloud service providers use SOC 2 reports to assess and address the risks associated with third party technology services. Independent third party auditors issue these reports that cover the principles of security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy.

SOC 2 Type I is different from Type II because a Type I assesses the design of security processes at a specific point in time. While a Type II report assesses how effective those controls are over time by observing operations for a minimum of six months.
