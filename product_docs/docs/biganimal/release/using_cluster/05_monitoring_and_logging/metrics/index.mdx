BigAnimal collects a wide set of metrics about Postgres instances and makes them available
in your Cloud Provider. Most of these metrics are acquired directly from Postgres system tables,
views, and functions. The Postgres documentation serves as the main reference for these metrics.

Some data from Postgres monitoring system views, tables, and functions are
transformed to be easier to consume in Prometheus metrics format. For example,
timestamp fields are generally converted to Unix epoch time and can be accompanied
by a relative time-interval metric. Other metrics are aggregated into
categories by label dimensions to limit the number of very specific and
narrowly scoped individual metrics emitted. It is not very useful to
report the inactivity period of every single backend, for example, so backend
statistics are aggregated by database, user, `application_name`, and backend
state.

Prometheus [labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels)
are included in the $.Message.labels JSON object.
Dimensions vary depending on the individual metric and are documented
separately for each group of related metrics.

The available set of metrics is subject to change. Metrics might be added,
removed or renamed. Where feasible, an effort will be made not to change the
meaning or type of existing metrics without also changing the metric name.

### Other metrics streams

In addition to postgres metrics from the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator that
manages databases in BigAnimal, you can stream additional metrics about Kubernetes cluster
state and other details to your Cloud Platform. Any such metrics
are generally well-known metrics from widely used tools, documented by the
upstream vendor of the component.

Details on individual metrics from such sources are not listed in this
document. Refer to the documentation of the tool or project that defines the
metrics.

See also:

-   [Kubernetes cluster metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/).

The cloud platform can supply additional streams of metrics
directly to your metrics, analytics, and dashboarding endpoint.
