title: BigAnimal Terraform provider
---

BigAnimalâ€™s [Terraform provider](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal) NEED LINK HERE is an infrastructure-as-code service that allows you to provision cloud resources with the Terraform CLI and incorporate those resources into your existing BigAnimal cloud infrastructure workflows.  

The current version of the Terraform provider offers modules for creating, reading, updating, and deleting clusters and regions.

!!!note
   We provide support for the BigAnimal Terraform provider itself and not for the underlying environment. 

## Prerequisites
To use Terraform with BigAnimal, you need: 

- A BigAnimal account with an organization set up. If you don't already have a BigAnimal account, see [Getting started with the BigAnimal free trial](/biganimal/latest/).

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) downloaded and installed.
- An API key for use within the Terraform application. See [Getting an API Token](getting-an-api-token).

## Configure the provider

*How do you do this? and would the correct heading be Configure the provider or Authenticate the provider?*

```
terraform {
  provider "biganimal" {
    public_key=
    private_key=
    }
  }
}
```

See [Provider Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration).


## Getting an API Token

To use the BigAnimal API, use the following procedure to fetch an API bearer token and export it into your environment. For additional information about using the BigAnimal API, see [here](/biganimal/latest/reference/).

1. Access the script located [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/api/get-token.sh).
1. Open the script in `Raw` format.
1. Copy the script and save it locally with the name `get-token.sh`.
1. Modify permissions for the script in your local shell.
1. Run the script locally using a command like the following:
    ```
     sh <local path>/get-token.sh
    ```
  The resulting output instructs you to log in to a URL with an 8-digit user code. For example: 
    ```
     Please login to https://auth.biganimal.com/activate?user_code=JWPL-RCXL with your BigAnimal account
    ``` 
1. In a browser, access the URL, confirm, and re-authenticate if necessary. 
  You should receive a notice that the code has been verified.
1. In your local shell a prompt asks:
    ```
     Have you finished the login successfully. (y/N)
    ```
1. When you enter `y`, the shell responds with output that provides the access token, refresh token, scope, expiration period, and token type.
1. Export the access token into your environment as follows, replacing `<REDACTED>` with the access token.
    ```bash
    export BA_BEARER_TOKEN=<REDACTED>
    ```
1. Now you can follow along with the example in the Terraform repository". NEED LINK TO TERRAFORM REGISTRY WHEN WE ARE REGISTERED.
