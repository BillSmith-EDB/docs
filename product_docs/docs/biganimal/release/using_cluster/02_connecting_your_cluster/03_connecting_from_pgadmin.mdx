title: Connecting from pgAdmin
---

In the pgAdmin client, you can connect to your BigAnimal cluster. The pgAdmin tool allows you to inspect, monitor, manage, and query your cluster's databases from a desktop or web UI.

## Prerequisites

- Sign in to [BigAnimal](portal.biganimal.com) and create a cluster. For instructions, see [Creating a cluster](../../getting_started/creating_a_cluster/). 

- Install the pgAdmin tool. To install pgAdmin, see the [Download](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) page on the pgAdmin site. 

!!!Note
   When pgAdmin opens for the first time, it asks you to set a master password. The master password secures your connections and credentials.

## Connecting to your cluster

To connect to your BigAnimal cluster, you need to enter its values into pgAdmin. Find the values in BigAnimal:

1. Open BigAnimal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

1. Select the cluster you want to connect to.

1. Select the **Overview** tab. 

1. Under **Quick Connect**, a command appears like in the example:

      ```shell
      $ psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@p-n85scw2ies.fcrziuxgkqazmhkl.s.edbcloud.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
      ```

The command contains the values to connect your cluster. Enter the values:

1. Open pgAdmin.

1. In the **Quick Links** panel, select **Add New Server**. 

1. In the Create-Server dialog box, under the **General** tab, enter a server name in the **Name** field. 

1. Select the **Connection** tab.

1. In the **Host name/address** field, enter the server address. Find the server address in the BigAnimal **Quick Connect** connection string. In the example, the server address is `p-n85scw2ies.fcrziuxgkqazmhkl.s.edbcloud.io`. 

1. In the **Port** field, enter the port name. Find the port name after the server address in the BigAnimal **Quick Connect** connection string. In the example, the port name is `5432`.  

1. In the **Maintenance database** field, enter the maintenance database name. Find the maintenance database name before the server address in the BigAnimal **Quick Connect** connection string. In the example, the maintenance database name is `edb_admin`

1. In the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the cluster's administrator credentials. These are the same credentials you set when configuring the cluster. 

1. In the **SSL** tab, set the **SSL mode** field to **Require**. 

1. Select **Save**. pgAdmin attempts to connect to the BigAnimal cluster.
