title: Connecting from pgAdmin
---

In the pgAdmin client, you can connect to your BigAnimal cluster. 

## Prerequisites

- Sign in to [BigAnimal](portal.biganimal.com) and create a cluster. For instructions, see [Creating a cluster](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/). 

- Install the pgAdmin tool. To install pgAdmin, see the [Download](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) page on the pgAdmin site. 

!!!Note
   When pgAdmin opens for the first time, it asks you to set a master password. The master password secures your connections and credentials.

## Connecting to your cluster

1. Open pgAdmin.

1. In the **Quick Links** panel, select **Add New Server**. Alternatively, right-click on **Servers** and select **Create > Server**. A **Create-Server** dialog box opens. 

1. In the **General** tab, enter a server name in the **Name** field. 

1. Open BigAnimal:

   1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

   1. Select the cluster you want.

   1. Select the **Overview** tab. 

1. Enter the server address: 

   1. In BigAnimal, under **QUICK CONNECT** copy the server address. The server address is in the **QUICK COMMAND** connection string. For example, the server address is `p-n85scw2ies.fcrziuxgkqazmhkl.s.edbcloud.io` in this command:

      ```shell
      $ psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@p-n85scw2ies.fcrziuxgkqazmhkl.s.edbcloud.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
      ```

   1. In pgAdmin, select the **Connection** tab. 

   1. In the **Host name/address** field, paste the server address.

1. Enter the port:

   1. In BigAnimal, under **QUICK CONNECT** copy the port. The port appears after the server address. In the example, the port is `5432`.

   1. In pgAdmin, paste the port name in the **Port** field.

1. Enter the maintenance database:

   1. In BigAnimal, under **QUICK CONNECT** copy the maintenance database. The maintenance databse appears before the server address. In the example, the maintenance database is `edb_admin`. 
   
   1. In pgAdmin, paste the maintenance database in the **Maintenance database** field. 

1. In the **Connection** tab, enter the cluster's administrator credentials in the **Username** and **Password** fields. These are the same credentials you set when configuring the cluster. 

1. In the **SSL** tab, set the **SSL mode** field to **Require**. 

1. Select **Save** and pgAdmin attempts to connect to the BigAnimal cluster.
