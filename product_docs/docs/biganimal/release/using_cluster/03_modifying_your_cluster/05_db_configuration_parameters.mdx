title: Modifying database configuration parameters
---

The database parameters listed on the DB Configuration tab are also referred to as Grand Unified Configuration (GUC) variables. See [What Is a GUC Variable?](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/what-guc-variable) for more information.

The list of parameters is populated based on the type of database you selected on the **Operational Settings** tab when you created your cluster. For more information about the parameters for your database type:

- For PostgreSQL parameters, see [Setting Parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html) and [Server Configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html) in the Postgres documentation.
     

- For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Summary of Configuration Parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/#summary_of_configuration_parameters) and [Configuration Parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/).

-  For more information on the types of values parameters accept, see [Parameter Names and Values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html#CONFIG-SETTING-NAMES-VALUES). The types apply to both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server parameters.


!!!note
Not all database configuration parameters are supported by BigAnimal. Some parameters, such as `wal_level` and `restore_command`, are reserved for EDB to provide the managed database features of BigAnimal.

## Using formulas for parameter values

In addition to entering specific values for parameters, for some parameters you can specify formulas to automatically calculate a value. You can use formulas for parameters of type integer and real using the following operators: `+ - / * > >= < <= == != && || ! ? : ( )`. GUCs used in formulas must also be of type integer or real. 

BigAnimal has what we refer to as psuedo GUCs to facilitate creating equations. These read-only GUCs are:
- `cpu_cores`
- `disk_iops`
- `disk_size`
- `ram`
- `replica_count` (node count)

`ram` and `disk_size` have the default unit of KB. 

You can't use GUCs with different types of units (such as size or duration) in formulas. For example, you can't use a formula that tries to multiply two seconds with three kilobytes (2s \* 3KB), but you can use a formula that multiplies two sizes even if they have different scales (2KB \* 8GB).

Formulas can calculate a value relative to the specifications you selected for the cluster or relative to other non-pseudo GUCs. If you resize your cluster, BigAnimal recalculates formulas using the new values for the pseudo GUCs. 


### Example 

This example uses a formula for the `shared_buffers` parameter value.

Instead of entering a specific value for the `shared_buffers` parameter, with GUC equations, you can specify that the value for `shared_buffers` should be 25% of RAM, but no higher than 8GB: 

`((ram * 0.25) > 8 GB) ? 8 GB : (ram * 0.25)`


## Modify a parameter

1.  Go to the parameter you want to modify using these methods:
    -   To search for a specific parameter, use the search field. 
    -   To filter the parameters that show, select one of the following in the **Show only** list:
        -   Custom Values — Shows only parameters that changed from the default values, either in the current session or modified in a previous session and applied to the cluster.
        -   Currently Edited Values — Shows only parameters that changed during the current editing session.

2.  Enter the new value in the parameter value field. 

    !!! Danger 
    Parameters identified with a yellow exclamation point icon trigger a restart when you save your changes. The restart terminates all open connections and takes a few minutes to complete. It takes a few more seconds for the new connection to establish. During this process, it isn't possible to connect to the database.
    !!!

3.  Save your changes.
