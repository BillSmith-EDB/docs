title: Postgres extensions

BigAnimal supports many Postgres extensions. See [Supported Postgres extensions](/pg_extensions/latest/) for the complete list.

## Installing extensions

Use the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command to install extensions. 

You need superuser privileges to install most extensions on BigAnimal. If an extension is trusted, it does not require superuser privileges to install. The Postgres documentation for an extension indicates if it is trusted or not. The links on [Appendix F. Additional Supplied Modules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html) bring you to the documentation for each extension.

### Example: Installing multiple extensions

One way of installing multiple extensions simultaneously is to:

1. Create a text file containing the CREATE EXTENSION command for each of the extensions you want to install. In this example, we've named the file `create_extensions.sql`.

   ```text
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_1> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_2> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_3> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_4> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   ```

1. Use your Postgres client of choice to load the extensions. For example, using psql:

   ```shell
   psql <biganimal_connection_string> -f create_extensions.sql
   ```
   For more information about connecting to your cluster using a client, see [Connecting to your cluster](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/).

## Extensions requiring superuser privileges

Certain extensions require superuser privileges in order to use the extension:

| Extensions requiring superuser to use |                             Notes                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| amcheck                               | Can be granted to others                                      |
| pageinspect                           |                                                               |
| pg_buffercache                        | superuser or pg_monitor role                                  |
| pg_freespacemap                       | superuser or pg_stat_scan_tables role                      |
| pgrowlocks                            | superuser or pg_stat_scan_tables role                      |
| pgstattuple                           | superuser or pg_stat_scan_tables role                      |
| pg_visibility                         | superuser or pg_stat_scan_tables role                      |

## Working with extensions

Use the [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html) command to remove extensions. 

Use the [pg_available_extensions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-available-extensions.html) view to see a list of all PostreSQL extensions.

The [catalog_pg_extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-extension.html) catalog stores information about the installed extensions.
