## Creating an Azure Private Endpoint 

To connect to your cluster from your application's virtual network in Azure:

10. If you prefer to create the Private Endpoint using the Azure CLI, either use your local terminal with an Azure CLI profile already configured or open a new Azure Cloud Shell using the Azure portal.

11. Use the following Azure CLI command to create the Private Endpoint by setting these parameters:

    ```shell
    az network private-endpoint create \
        --connection-name p-mckwlbakq5-rw-internal-lb \
        --name vnet-client-private-pg-service \
        --private-connection-resource-id "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mc_dp-brcxzr08qr7rbei1-japaneast-1_japaneast/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateLinkServices/p-mckwlbakq5-rw-internal-lb" \
        --resource-group rg-client \
        --subnet snet-client \
        --vnet-name vnet-client \
        --subscription test
    ```

    -   `connection-name` needs to be the Private Link Service name, like `p-mckwlbakq5-rw-internal-lb`.

    -   `name` will be the Private Endpoint name, like `vnet-client-private-pg-service`.

    -   `private-connection-resource-id` is the Azure Resource Manager path of the Private Link Service.

    -   `resource-group` is the Resource Group in which the Private Endpoint will be created.

    -   `subnet` is the Azure VNet subnet in which the Private Endpoint will be created.

    -   `vnet-name` is the Azure VNet name in which the Private Endpoint will be created.

    -   `subscription` is the Azure subscription in which the Private Endpoint will be created.
