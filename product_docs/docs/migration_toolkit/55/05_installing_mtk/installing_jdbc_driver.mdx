Migration Toolkit requires Java version 1.8.0 or later.

Which JDBC driver you use depends on the what database you are migrating from or to:

- If you're migrating to or from EDB Postgres Advanced Server, use the EDB JDBC driver. To download the latest driver, see [EDB Connectors](https://enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#edb-connectors) on the EDB Downloads page. 

- If you're migrating to or from PostgreSQL, use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. To download the latest supported driver, see the [JDBC drivers section](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/) on the PostgreSQL Downloads page. 

- If you're migrating from Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL, use a freely available source-specific JDBC driver. For a link to a vendor download site, see [Third Party JDBC Drivers](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#third-party-jdbc-drivers) on the EDB Downloads page. 

After downloading the driver, move the driver file into the `<mtk_install_dir>/lib` directory.
