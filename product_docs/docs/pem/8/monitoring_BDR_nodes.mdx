!!! Tip "New Feature "
    PGD support is available in PEM version 8.1.0 and later.

PGD (Bi-Directional Replication) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides multimaster replication between the Postgres clusters. Before you monitor PGD through PEM console, you must ensure that your PGD nodes are up and running. For more information, see [PGD](/pgd/latest).

You can configure PEM to display status information about one or more PGD nodes using dashboards in PEM version 8.1.0 and PGD version 3.7.9 and later.

To configure PEM to monitor PGD nodes, use the PEM web client to create a server definition. Use the tabs on the [New Server Registration](/pem/latest/pem_online_help/01_toc_pem_getting_started/07_pem_define_connection/) dialog box to specify general connection properties for the PGD node with the following exceptions:

-   Specify the PGD-enabled database name in the **Database** field of the **PEM Agent** tab.

-   Specify the user having the pgd_monitor or pgd_superuser role in the **username** field of the **PEM Agent** tab.

After saving the server definition, the PGD node is included in the list of servers under the PEM server directory in the PEM client object browser tree. You can monitor the PGD nodes from PGD dashboards.

To include monitoring information on the PGD dashboards, you must enable the relative probes for each PGD group. See the complete list of PGD [probes](monitoring_performance/probes/#pgd-probes).

To enable a probe, right-click the node name, and select **Management > Manage Probes**.

To monitor the PGD Node, right-click the name of the PGD node in the object browser tree. From the **Dashboards** menu, select the PGD Admin, PGD Group Monitoring, or PGD Node Monitoring dashboard.
