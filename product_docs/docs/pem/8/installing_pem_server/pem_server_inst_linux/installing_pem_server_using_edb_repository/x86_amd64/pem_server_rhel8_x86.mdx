On a RHEL or OL system, you can use the `dnf` command to install a PEM server. The installation tool you use depends on the version of the host operating system. Before installing the server, you must ensure that your system contains the required prerequisite software.

## Prerequisites

- Postres Enterprise Manager requires a Postgres server running either [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) or [PostgresSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) version 11 or later to hold the Postgres Enterprise Manager backend database. 
  
  1. Install the Postgres server. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Linux](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux) or [Installing PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/).
  
  2. Configure authentication on the Postgres server by updating the `pg_hba.conf` file. The `pg_hba.conf` file manages connections. You must ensure that the `pg_hba.conf` file allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the Apache web server server.
  
     - If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

     - If you're using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

  3.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed on your Postgres server.

      -   If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed by default.

      -   If you're using PostgreSQL, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and then install the `sslutils` extension and the `hstore` contrib module: 

          ```shell
          dnf install postgresql-<x>_sslutils postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where, `x` is the Postgres server version.

   4.  If you're using a firewall, allow access to port 8443 on the Postgres server:

       ```shell
       firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
       firewall-cmd --reload
       ```

-  Ensure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on, such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl, are up to date: 

   ```shell
   dnf upgrade
   ```


## Install and configure the edb.repo file

To create an EnterpriseDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```shell
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

```shell
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Install the PEM server

After meeting the platform-specific prerequisites, you can use dnf to install the PEM server:

```shell
dnf install edb-pem
```

!!! Note
    The operating system user pem is created while installing the PEM server. The PEM Server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session is saved to this user's home directory.

When you install an RPM package that's signed by a source that isn't recognized by your system, yum might ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press **Return** to continue.

During the installation, yum might encounter a dependency that it can't resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies to manually resolve.

If you want to install PEM server on a machine that's in isolated network, you must first create a PEM repository on that machine. For more information, see [Creating a PEM repository in an isolated network](../../creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network/).

After installing PEM server using yum or dnf, you need to configure the PEM server. For detailed information, see [Configuring the PEM server on Linux platforms](../../configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).
