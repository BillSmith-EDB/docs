Before you begin the installation process:

1. Review the [prerequisites](/pem/latest/installing_pem_server/installing_on_linux/prerequisites/).

2. Log in as superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
#  Set up the EDB repository:
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

#  Replace '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' below with
#  your username and password for the EDB repository:
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```


## Install the package

```shell
yum -y install edb-pem
```

## Initial configuration

```shell
# You can configure the PEM server using the following command:
/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
```

For more details, see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux](/pem/latest/installing_pem_server/installing_on_linux/configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).

!!! Note

- The operating system user pem is created while installing the PEM server. The PEM server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session is saved to this user's home directory.

- If you're doing a fresh installation of the PEM server on a RHEL 7.x host, the installer also installs edb-python3-mod_wsgi packages with the installation required by the operating system.

- If you're upgrading the PEM server on a RHEL 7.x host, the mod_wsgi system package is replaced by the edb-python3-mod_wsgi package as required by the operating system.
