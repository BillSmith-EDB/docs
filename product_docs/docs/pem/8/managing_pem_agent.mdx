The sections that follow provide information about the behavior and management of a PEM agent.

## Managing job notifications

You can configure the settings in PEM console for sending the SMTP trap on success or failure of a system-generated job (listed under scheduled tasks) or a custom-defined agent job. These email notification settings can be configured at following three levels (in order of precedence) to send email notifications to the specified user group:

-   Job level
-   Agent level
-   PEM server level (default level)

### Configuring job notifications at job level

You can configure email notification settings at job level only for a custom-defined agent job in one of the following ways:

-   For a new agent job, you can configure the email notification settings in the `Notification` tab of `Create-Agent Job` wizard while creating the job itself.
-   For an existing custom-defined job, you can edit the properties of the job and configure the notification settings.

![Configure Job Notification - Job level](images/job_notifications_job_level.png)

Use the fields on the `Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

-   Use the `Send the notifications` field to specify when you want the email notifications to be sent.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.

### Configuring job notifications at agent level

Select the agent in the tree view, right click and select *Properties*. In the `Properties` dialog, select the *Job notifications* tab.

![Configure Job Notification - Agent level](images/job_notifications_agent_level.png)

Use the fields on the Job notifications tab to configure the email notification settings on agent level:

-   Use the `Override default configuration?` switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. If you select *Yes* for this switch, you can use the rest of the settings on this dialog to define when and to whom the job notifications should be sent. Please note that the rest of the settings on this dialog work only if you enable the `Override default configuration?` switch.
-   Use the `Email on job completion?` switch to specify if the job notification should be sent on the successful job completion.
-   Use the `Email on a job failure?` switch to specify if the job notification should be sent on the failure of a job.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group to whom the job notification should be sent.

### Configuring job notifications at server level

You can use the *Server Configuration* dialog to provide information about your email notification configuration at PEM server level. To open the Server Configuration dialog, select *Server Configuration...* from the PEM client's Management menu.

![Configure Job Notification - Server level](images/job_notifications_server_level.png)

Four server configuration parameters specify information about your job notification preferences at PEM server level:

-   Use the `job_failure_notification` switch to specify if you want to send email notification after each job failure.
-   Use the `job_notification_email_group` parameter to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.
-   Use the `job_retention_time parameter` to specify the number of days that non-recurring scheduled tasks should be retained in the system.
-   Use the `job_status_change_notification` switch to specify if you want to send email notification after each job status change, irrespective of its status being a failure, success, or interrupted.

## Managing PEM scheduled jobs

You can create a PEM scheduled job to perform a set of custom-defined steps in the specified sequence. These steps may contain SQL code or a batch/shell script that you may run on a server that is bound with the agent. You can schedule these jobs to suit your business requirements. For example, you can create a job for taking a backup of a particular database server and schedule it to run on a specific date and time of every month.

To create or manage a PEM scheduled job, use the PEM tree control to browse to the PEM agent for which you want to create the job. The tree control will display a Jobs node, under which currently defined jobs are displayed. To add a new job, right click on the `Jobs` node, and select `Create Job...` from the context menu.

When the `Create - Agent Job` dialog opens, use the tabs on the `Create - Agent Job` dialog to define the steps and schedule that make up a PEM scheduled job.

![Create Agent Job - General tab](images/create_pem_jobs_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to provide general information about a job:

-   Provide a name for the job in the `Name` field.
-   Move the `Enabled` switch to the `Yes` position to enable a job, or `No` to disable a job.
-   Use the `Comment` field to store notes about the job.

![Create Agent Job - Steps tab](images/create_pem_jobs_steps.png)

Use the `Steps` tab to define and manage the steps that the job will perform. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add a new step; then click the compose icon (located at the left side of the header) to open the step definition dialog:

![Create Agent Job - Steps tab - General tab](images/create_pem_jobs_steps_definition.png)

Use fields on the step definition dialog to define the step:

-   Provide a name for the step in the `Name` field; please note that steps will be performed in alphanumeric order by name.

-   Use the `Enabled` switch to include the step when executing the job (`True`) or to disable the step (`False`).

-   Use the `Kind` switch to indicate if the job step invokes SQL code (`SQL`) or a batch script (`Batch`).

    -   If you select `SQL`, use the `Code` tab to provide SQL code for the step.
    -   If you select `Batch`, use the `Code` tab to provide the batch script that will be executed during the step.

-   Use the `On error` drop-down to specify the behavior of pgAgent if it encounters an error while executing the step. Select from:

    -   Fail - Stop the job if you encounter an error while processing this step.
    -   Success - Mark the step as completing successfully, and continue.
    -   Ignore - Ignore the error, and continue.

-   If you have selected SQL as your input for `Kind` switch, provide the following additional information:

    -   Use the `Server` field to specify the server that is bound with the agent for which you are creating the PEM scheduled job.
    -   Use the `Database` field to specify the database that is associated with the server that you have selected.

-   Use the `Comment` field to provide a comment about the step.

![Create Agent Job - Steps tab - Code tab](images/create_pem_jobs_steps_definition_code.png)

-   Use the context-sensitive field on the step definition dialog's `Code` tab to provide the SQL code or batch script that will be executed during the step:

    -   If the step invokes SQL code, provide one or more SQL statements in the `SQL query` field.

    -   If the step invokes a batch script, provide the script in the `Code` field. If you are running on a Windows server, standard batch file syntax must be used. When running on a Linux server, any shell script may be used, provided that a suitable interpreter is specified on the first line (e.g. *#!/bin/sh*). Along with the defined inline code, you can also provide the path of any batch script, shell script, or SQL file on the filesystem.

        -   To invoke a script on a Linux system, you must modify the entry for `batch_script_user` parameter in the `agent.cfg` file and specify the user that should be used to run the script. You can either specify a non-root user or root for this parameter. If you do not specify a user, or the specified user does not exist, then the script will not be executed. Restart the agent after modifying the file.

        -   To invoke a script on a Windows system, set the registry entry for `AllowBatchJobSteps` to `true` and restart the PEM agent. PEM registry entries are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent`.

After providing all the information required by the step, click the `Save` button to save and close the step definition dialog.

Click the add icon (+) to add each additional step, or select the `Schedules` tab to define the job schedule.

Click the add icon (+) to add a schedule for the job; then click the compose icon (located at the left side of the header) to open the schedule definition dialog:

![Create Agent Job - Schedules tab - General tab](images/create_pem_jobs_schedules.png)

Use the fields on the `Schedules definition` tab to specify the days and times at which the job will execute.

-   Provide a name for the schedule in the `Name` field.
-   Use the `Enabled` switch to indicate that pgAgent should use the schedule (`Yes`) or to disable the schedule (`No`).
-   Use the calendar selector in the `Start` field to specify the starting date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the calendar selector in the `End` field to specify the ending date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the `Comment` field to provide a comment about the schedule.

Select the `Repeat` tab to define the days on which the schedule will execute.

![Create Agent Job - Schedules tab - Repeat tab](images/create_pem_jobs_schedules_repeat.png)

Use the fields on the `Repeat` tab to specify the details about the schedule in a cron-style format. The job will execute on each date or time element selected on the `Repeat` tab.

Click within a field to open a list of valid values for that field; click on a specific value to add that value to the list of selected values for the field. To clear the values from a field, click the X located at the right-side of the field.

-   Use the fields within the `Days` box to specify the days on which the job will execute:
    -   Use the `Week Days` field to select the days on which the job will execute.
    -   Use the `Month Days` field to select the numeric days on which the job will execute. Specify the `Last Day` to indicate that the job should be performed on the last day of the month, irregardless of the date.
    -   Use the `Months` field to select the months in which the job will execute.
-   Use the fields within the `Times` box to specify the times at which the job will execute:
    -   Use the `Hours` field to select the hour at which the job will execute.
    -   Use the `Minutes` field to select the minute at which the job will execute.

Select the `Exceptions` tab to specify any days on which the schedule will `not` execute.

![Create Agent Job - Schedules tab - Exceptions tab](images/create_pem_jobs_schedules_exceptions.png)

Use the fields on the `Exceptions` tab to specify days on which you wish the job to not execute; for example, you may wish for jobs to not execute on national holidays.

Click the Add icon (+) to add a row to the exception table, then:

-   Click within the `Date` column to open a calendar selector, and select a date on which the job will not execute. Specify `<Any>` in the `Date` column to indicate that the job should not execute on any day at the time selected.
-   Click within the `Time` column to open a time selector, and specify a time on which the job will not execute. Specify `<Any>` in the `Time` column to indicate that the job should not execute at any time on the day selected.

Select the `Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

![Create Agent Job - Notifications tab](images/create_pem_jobs_notifications.png)

Use the fields on the `Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings for a job:

-   Use the `Send the notifications` field to specify when you want the email notifications to be sent.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.

When you've finished defining the schedule, you can use the `SQL` tab to review the code that will create or modify your job.

![Create Agent Job - SQL tab](images/create_pem_jobs_sql.png)

Click the `Save` button to save the job definition, or `Cancel` to exit the job without saving. Use the `Reset` button to remove your unsaved entries from the dialog.

After saving a job, the job will be listed under the `Jobs` node of the PEM tree control of the server on which it was defined. The `Properties` tab in the PEM console will display a high-level overview of the selected job, and the Statistics tab will show the details of each run of the job. To modify an existing job or to review detailed information about a job, right-click on a job name, and select `Properties` from the context menu.

## Agent privileges

By default, the PEM agent is installed with `root` privileges for the operating system host and superuser privileges for the database server. These privileges allow the PEM agent to invoke unrestricted probes on the monitored host and database server about system usage, retrieving and returning the information to the PEM server.

Please note that PEM functionality diminishes as the privileges of the PEM agent decrease. For complete functionality, the PEM agent should run as `root`. If the PEM agent is run under the database server's service account, PEM probes will not have complete access to the statistical information used to generate reports, and functionality will be limited to the capabilities of that account. If the PEM agent is run under another lesser-privileged account, functionality will be limited even further.

If you limit the operating system privileges of the PEM agent, some of the PEM probes will not return information, and the following functionality may be affected:

| Probe or Action                                 | Operating System | PEM Functionality Affected                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Service restart functionality                   | Linux/ Windows   | The Audit Log Manager, Server Log Manager Log Analysis Expert and PEM may be unable to apply requested modifications. |
| Package Deployment                              | Linux/ Windows   | PEM will be unable to run downloaded installation modules.                                                            |
| Batch Task                                      | Windows          | PEM will be unable to run scheduled batch jobs in Windows.                                                            |
| Collect data from server (root access required) | Linux/ Windows   | Columns such as swap usage, CPU usage, IO read, IO write will be displayed as 0 in the session activity dashboard.    |

!!! Note
    The above-mentioned list is not comprehensive, but should provide an overview of the type of functionality that will be limited.

If you restrict the database privileges of the PEM agent, the following PEM functionality may be affected:

| Probe                      | Operating System | PEM Functionality Affected                                                            |

| Tablespace Size            | Linux/Windows    | The Server Analysis dashboard will not display complete information.                  |
| xDB Replication            | Linux/Windows    | PEM will be unable to send xDB alerts and traps.                                      |

If the probe is querying the operating system with insufficient privileges, the probe may return a `permission denied` error.

If the probe is querying the database with insufficient privileges, the probe may return a `permission denied` error or display the returned data in a PEM chart or graph as an empty value.

When a probe fails, an entry will be written to the log file that contains the name of the probe, the reason the probe failed, and a hint that will help you resolve the problem.

You can view probe-related errors that occurred on the server in the `Probe Log` dashboard, or review error messages in the PEM worker log files. On Linux, the default location of the log file is:

 `/var/log/pem/worker.log`

On Windows, log information is available on the `Event Viewer`.

## Agent configuration

A number of user-configurable parameters and registry entries control the behavior of the PEM agent. You may be required to modify the PEM agent's parameter settings to enable some PEM functionality. After modifying values in the PEM agent configuration file, you must restart the PEM agent to apply any changes.

With the exception of the `PEM_MAXCONN` parameter, we strongly recommend against modifying any of the configuration parameters or registry entries listed below without first consulting EDB support experts *unless* the modifications are required to enable PEM functionality.

On Linux systems, PEM configuration options are stored in the `agent.cfg` file, located in `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc`. The `agent.cfg` file contains the following entries:

| Parameter Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default Value                                                                                                 |

## Agent properties

The PEM Agent `Properties` dialog provides information about the PEM agent from which the dialog was opened; to open the dialog, right-click on an agent name in the PEM client tree control, and select `Properties` from the context menu.

![PEM Agent Properties dialog - General tab](images/pem_agent_properties.png)

Use fields on the PEM Agent `Properties` dialog to review or modify information about the PEM agent:

-   The `Description` field displays a modifiable description of the PEM agent. This description is displayed in the tree control of the PEM client.

-   You can use groups to organize your servers and agents in the PEM client tree control. Use the `Group` drop-down listbox to select the group in which the agent will be displayed.

-   Use the `Team` field to specify the name of the group role that should be able to access servers monitored by the agent; the servers monitored by this agent will be displayed in the PEM client tree control to connected team members. Please note that this is a convenience feature. The Team field does not provide true isolation, and should not be used for security purposes.

-   The `Heartbeat interval` fields display the length of time that will elapse between reports from the PEM agent to the PEM server. Use the selectors next to the `Minutes` or `Seconds` fields to modify the interval.

    ![PEM Agent Properties dialog - Job Notifications tab](images/pem_agent_job_notification_properties.png)

    Use the fields on the `Job Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings on agent level:

    -   Use the `Override default configuration?` switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. If you select `Yes` for this switch, you can use the rest of the settings on this dialog to define when and to whom the job notifications should be sent. Please note that the rest of the settings on this dialog work only if you enable the `Override default configuration?` switch.
    -   Use the `Email on job completion?` switch to specify if the job notification should be sent on the successful job completion.
    -   Use the `Email on a job failure?` switch to specify if the job notification should be sent on the failure of a job.
    -   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group to whom the job notification should be sent.

    ![PEM Agent Properties dialog - Agent Configurations tab](images/pem_agent_configurations_properties.png)

    The `Agent Configurations` tab displays all the current configurations and capabilities of a agent.

    -   The `Parameter` column displays a list of parameters.
    -   The `Value` column displays the current value of the corresponding parameter.
    -   The `Category` column displays the category of the corresponding parameter; it can be either `configuration` or `capability`.
