title: "Changing the default port"
---

After installation, configure the PEM server. On Windows, configuration occurs automatically. On Linux, configure the server by running a script.

By default the 8443 port is assigned for the web services. You can change the port after configuration by changing a few parameters in the Apache configuration files. The Apache configuration files names and locations are platform specific.

## For RHEL and CentOS


- Edit the file `/etc/httpd/conf.d` file, replacing 8443 with your port number in the following parameters:
```ini
Listen 8443
<VirtualHost _default_:8443>
ServerName localhost:8443
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}:8443%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
```

- If semanage isn't installed, install it:
```shell
sudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python
```

- Check whether your port of your is listed:
```text
semanage port -l | grep http
```

- If your port doesn't appear in the list, then run this command:
```shell
sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp <your_port_number>
```

- Restart the httpd service
```shell
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```


ou can now access the PEM web interface using your port. For more details, see [Accessing the web interface](/pem/latest/pem_web_interface/).

## For Debian 10, Ubuntu 18 or 20


- Edit the file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/edb-ssl-pem.conf`, replacing 8443 with your port number in the following parameters:
```ini
Listen 8443
<VirtualHost _default_:8443>
ServerName HTTPD-EDBPEM-SERVER-v8:8443
```

- Restart the httpd service
```shell
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
