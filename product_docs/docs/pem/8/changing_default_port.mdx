title: "Changing the default port"
---

The PEM Server is configured after the installation either automatically (in Windows) or manually by running the configuration script (in Linux). While configuring the PEM Server, it, by default, assigns the 8443 port for the web service. You can change the port as per your requirement after configuration by changing a few parameters in the apache configuration files. The apache configuration files names and locations are platform specific.

## For RHEL and CentOS

```text
# In the file /etc/httpd/conf.d file, replace the port 8443 to your choice for the following parameters:
Listen 8443
<VirtualHost _default_:8443>
ServerName localhost:8443
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}:8443%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# Check if the port of your choice is listed:
semanage port -l | grep http

# If the port of your choice is not listed than run the below command:
sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp <port_number>

# Restart the httpd service
systemctl restart httpd
```

Where `<port_number>` is the port number of your choice.

!!! Note
    If semanage is not installed then install using `sudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python` command.

After restarting the httpd services you can access the PEM web interface using your new port. For more details see [Accessing the web interface](/pem/latest/pem_web_interface/).

## For Debian 10, Ubuntu 18 or 20

```text
# In the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/edb-ssl-pem.conf, replace the 8443 port to your choice for the following parameters:
Listen 8443
<VirtualHost _default_:8443>
ServerName HTTPD-EDBPEM-SERVER-v8:8443

# Restart the httpd service
systemctl restart httpd
```

After restarting the httpd services you can access the PEM web interface using your new port. For more details see [Accessing the web interface](/pem/latest/pem_web_interface/).
