The Postgres Expert utility provides expert advice on how to best configure your Postgres servers for optimal performance, security, and more. Postgres Expert serves as a PostgreSQL DBA-in-a-box by evaluating your servers for deviations in best practices. Postgres Expert contains three specialized experts:

-   Configuration Expert
-   Schema Expert
-   Security Expert

You can select specific rules for each expert to evaluate, or accept all rules, and then review Postgres Expert reports detailing any best practice issues that require your attention.

## Using the Postgres Expert wizard

To use the Postgres Expert wizard, in the PEM client select **Management > Postgres Expert**. In the Welcome window, select **Next** to continue.

In the **Experts/Rules** tree menu, select the experts and rules that you want evaluating your selected servers for best practice deviations.

The tree menu categorizes the rules under three experts:

-   **Configuration Expert** evaluates the parameter settings of the server or operating system to find any adjustments that might improve system performance.
-   **Schema Expert** evaluates schema objects (locating missing primary keys, foreign keys without indexes, etc.).
-   **Security Expert** evaluates the system to find security vulnerabilities.

After making your selections, select **Next** to continue.

Select or unselect the servers and databases that you want to evaluate. If you select multiple servers or databases, then the resulting report contains a separate evaluation of each target. When you've finished, select **Next** to continue.

To view the report in the client, select **View the report now**. To save a copy to an HTML file, select **Download the report**. If you choose to download the report, then the file saves to your default download directory. Select **Finish**. 

## Reviewing Postgres Expert recommendations

Postgres Expert produces an easy-to-navigate report that contains an evaluation of the selected rules. Each rule is categorized as high, medium, or low severity for the selected servers.

The report header contains a summary of the report that includes:

- The date and time of the report
- The number of rules evaluated
- The number of deviations from best practices

To jump to the section for a given server, select the server from the **Go to** list.

The body of the report contains the detailed findings for each of the selected servers. The findings are sorted by expert. Within each expert heading, any rule violations are ranked by severity.

Select each rule in the report to display details and recommendations for that rule. Within each rule, there are unique sections:

-   Advisor lists the name of the Postgres Expert advisor that prompted the recommendation.
-   Trigger displays a description of the rule that raised the alert.
-   Recommended Value displays the value to which Postgres Expert recommends setting the selected parameter.
-   Description displays information and advice about the parameter that caused the alert.
-   Current Values displays the current value(s) of any parameter(s) that influence the Postgres Expert's evaluation.
