| Enhancement | Added the ability to copy probes and alerts to all servers in a group without having to select them individually.                                                                                         |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue whereby alert notifications were sent for Low or Medium alerts when the user had selected not to receive them. [Support Ticket #87664]                                                     |

| Other       | The PGD Worker Errors probe and associated alert template and dashboard chart have been removed as they were found to produce incorrect data. They will be replaced with a new probe in a future release. |
