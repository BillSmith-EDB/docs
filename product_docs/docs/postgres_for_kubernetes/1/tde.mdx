!!! Important
    TDE is available *only* for operands that support it:
    EPAS versions 15 and newer.

Transparent Data Encryption, or TDE, is a technology used by several database
vendors to encrypt data at rest, i.e. database files on disk.
TDE does not however encrypt data in use.

Starting with version 15, EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) is offering TDE.

<!-- NOTE: EPAS 15 is not in the official documentation yet. There is a preview
at https://deploy-preview-3385--edb-docs-staging.netlify.app/docs/tde/latest/ -->

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator includes support for TDE,
for any operand versions that offer TDE (EPAS version 15 and newer).

Activating TDE on the operator is simple. In the `epas` section of the manifest,
use the `tde` stanza to enable TDE, and set the Kubernetes secret to use that
will hold the TDE encryption key.

For example:

```yaml
  [â€¦]
  postgresql:
    epas:
      tde:
        enabled: true
        secretKeyRef:
          name: tde-key
          key: key
```

You can find the full example in
[`cluster-example-tde.yaml`](../samples/cluster-example-tde.yaml)
Note that this file also contains the definition of the Secret to hold the
encryption key.

With TDE activated, both the file disks for tables, as well as WAL files,
will be encrypted.
